# Project 

The goal of this assessment is to implement a web client for a Pok√©mon Viewer, using the open REST PokeAPI.
We value your time, so you should not take more than 5 hours doing this challenge. If you are stuck, or taking too much time on a particular area, we suggest you move on (see our Evaluation Criteria).

The technology used should be React, using create-react-app as a base. You can use other frameworks or even vanilla JS if you are more comfortable with those. Refrain from using other dependencies, unless properly justified. You may use a Styling library (ie: styled-components, emotion) if you prefer.

## Specifications

Implement the following mockup (Desktop and Mobile versions): https://www.figma.com/file/xSfHduJsNGqcYjE4oakJgC/PokeViewer-Coding-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1
The chart you see is the Stats chart, in a Radar Chart format (explained in more detail below). You should use Chart.js to implement it.

## Self Reflection

Time Spent 6 hours 17 minutes (not including time for this ReadMe) 

Goal was to mimick the mock up and then work backwards and refactor code/fix styling. Since the alotted time was 5 hours I didnt want to spend to much time going overboard, so I set a timer for coding to keep track tried to stay at 6 hours max but had to go a little over hehe. 

Key things I wanted to address but did not have time to:

Organization,
Testing,
Layout/mobile responsiveness,
Remove case sensitivity for search bar,
Capitalize pokemon name,
Chart,

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
